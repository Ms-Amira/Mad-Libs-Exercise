# Mad-Libs-Exercise

## About

This project is an interactive MadLibs exercise based on a spooky story. The story revolves around a thrilling experience in a haunted house on a stormy night. As the protagonist ventures into the eerie house, the creaking walls whisper chilling sounds, and a ghost appears with glowing eyes, sending a shiver down their spine.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to fundamental JavaScript concepts while creating your own Mad Lib. By using dynamic string insertion and working with variables, objects, and boolean expressions, you will be able to manipulate and customize the story, making it an engaging and educational experience.

## Objectives

- Understand Template Literals: Learn how to use template literals (``) to dynamically insert variables into a string.

- Variable Declaration and Assignment: Practice declaring variables using const and let.

- Understand Data Types: Learn how to work with different data types in JavaScript (strings, numbers, booleans, objects).

- Manipulating Objects: Learn how to define objects with properties and access them using dot notation.

- Boolean Expressions: Understand how to write and evaluate boolean expressions to represent logical conditions.
